    <h1>BEST HORROR SCENES</h1>
    <h3>An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes in horror.</h3>
    <p>“Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the most affecting in horror.
      Some may be simple black cat scares, others may be more subdued or nuanced.
      Many come from films that aren't necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.</p>

      <h4>Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by Brandon Durham.
        Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is recommended you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the
        film.</h4>

          <h4>The Babadook (2016)</h4>
          <h5>Directed by Jennifer Kent</h5>

        <p>I originally discovered Eden Lake when I was researching films in the New French Extremity movement. While
          Eden Lake doesn’t belong to this movement — it isn’t “extreme” or French — I would say it’s definitely New
          French Extremity adjacent. Interestingly enough, I remember the film being pretty brutal, but upon a re-watch
          I found much of the violence in the film is implied and not explicit. Many of the more difficult scenes show
          only a few frames of the violence and leave you to fill in the blanks, or you can hear what’s going on but
          can’t actually see anything.

          My husband Michael and I did show this film to a close friend once. We were in a literal cabin in the woods
          outside of Asheville, North Carolina, which should by all intents and purposes heighten the effects of any
          good Horror film, but it wasn’t to be. We were sitting on a super itchy couch that in fact turned out not to
          just be itchy, but infested with fleas. We didn’t realize until the movie was over, but sitting there
          scratching away for two hours made it difficult to really enjoy the movie. We loved it as much as the first
          time, and our friend didn’t like it at all. I’m gonna blame the fleas.</p>
